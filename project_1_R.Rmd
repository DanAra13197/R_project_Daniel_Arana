#Loaded necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)# This library enables layering of data and aesthetics, making it easy to build complex visualizations by adding layers incrementally.
library(dplyr)# This library focuses on simplicity and performance for tasks like filtering, selecting, arranging, mutating, and summarizing data.

#First, is imortant to understand the distribution for All Employees
#This histogram show the overall distributions of salaries in USD for all employees in the dataset.
#Helps identify the general range and frequency of salaries
##### 1. Salary Distribution for All Employees
ggplot(data, aes(x=salary_in_usd)) +
geom_histogram(binwidth=10000, fill="blue", color="red") +
labs(title="Salary Distribution (USD)", x="Salary in USD", y="Frequencia")
```


```{R}
##### 2. Salary Comparison: U.S. vs Offshore
#This histogram compares the salary distributions for employees based in the United States (US-Based) versus those offshore. Each bar is split by location
#Compare the salary ranges for U.S.-based employees against offshore employees
data= data %>%
mutate(Location=ifelse(employee_residence == "US", "US-Based", "Offshore"))
ggplot(data, aes(x=salary_in_usd, fill=Location)) +
geom_histogram(binwidth=10000, position="dodge", alpha=0.7) + 
labs(title = "Salary Comparison: US-Based employers vs Offshore employers", x="Salary in American Dollars", y="Frequency") +
scale_fill_manual(values = c("US-Based" = "blue", "Offshore" = "red"))
```

```{R}
##### 3. Salary by Experience Level
#This histogram divides the salary data based on experience levels (Entry-level, Mid-level, Senior-level, Executive-level). Each group has its own color
#This allows to see trends, such as higher salaries for Senior and Executive roles, and helps ensure that the company offers competitive rates for experience levels
ggplot(data, aes(x=salary_in_usd, fill=experience_level)) +#"fill is an aesthetic that determines the color used to fill elements in the plot" Not sure how this part of the ggplot works, but without it, whe I try to run it it give me error
geom_histogram(binwidth=10000, position="dodge", alpha=0.7) +#"dodge" places overlapping bars, which I think make it looks easier to read
labs(title="Salary Distribution by Experience Levels", x = "Salary in American Dollars", y = "Frequency") +
scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set3")#The other palette were hard to see the different colors 
#scale_fill_brewer, I found this function when I asked to an AI, different ways to make histogrmas. An histogram, in my opinnion shows better the different informations in a graph rather a plot chart which is a little confusing

#This histogram shows the frequency of different remote work ratios: No remote work, partially remote, fully remote levels in other words this shows correlation between remote work and salary
